# Source of Eralp Karaduman's CV

## [eralpkaraduman.github.io/cv](https://eralpkaraduman.github.io/cv)

This is a fairly modified version of
[elipapa's markdown-cv](http://elipapa.github.io/markdown-cv) project.  
Which is using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to host the cv as static site on github.

My version simply uses
[sindresorhus's github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) the close
replica of github's markdown style. 

If you want to have your own, just fork this repo and modify the `index.md`.

## Running jekyll locally
(You don't need to run it locally to update this, do it on github's web ui)  
You should look at [jekyll's own documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs) but,
this is how you'd get started;  

`bundle install`  
`bundle exec jekyll serve`
